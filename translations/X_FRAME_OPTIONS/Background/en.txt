This header entry determines whether a [[Browser]] is allowed to render a page in a ''frame'' or ''iframe''. This can prevent so-called clickjacking attacks by making sure that the website is not embedded in another website. The following options are available:
'''DENY:''' The page is not rendered if it is being loaded in a ''frame'' or ''iframe''.<br>
'''SAMEORIGIN:''' The page is only rendered if the ''frame'' or ''iframe'' is located in the same domain.<br>
'''ALLOW-FROM DOMAIN:''' The page is not rendered if the domain is different from the domain specified here.
