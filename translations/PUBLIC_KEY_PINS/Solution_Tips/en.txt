The setting of Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is not an absolute must, and is currently not taken into account by the SIWECOS Scanner.

The browsers Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome comply with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning] and therefore ignore HPKP-headers. If only a single pin is set, an error message will appear. In order for pin validation to be successful, it is therefore always necessary to provide at least two public keys or a back-up pin. Interested parties should get in touch with an IT security expert or web developer.
