Criminals could intercept your customers' personal data, such as passwords or credit card information. There is also the risk that criminals may install  viruses or a trojan on your website. In such a case, you may even be liable for damages suffered by your visitors. Criminals could also create seemingly "legitimate" duplicates of your website. With theses faked phishing sites, personal data such as passwords or credit card information can be intercepted while the customer believes that he or she is visiting a legitimate company website.
