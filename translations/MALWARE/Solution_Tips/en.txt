Restore a malware-free backup!
To do this, delete all the files on your webspace. In this way, you will make sure that you do not overlook malicious files from the compromised system which were used as a backdoor by the attackers.
Before restoring from the backup, make sure that the intended backup is not yet infected by the malicious code that we detected, and if necessary, use an even older backup.
If the backup is malware-free, restore it and then install any updates for your system. Only after this is done, put the website back online.
