In the worst case, a weak hash algorithm can allow attackers to create a forged certificate for your website and thus to "hack" your website. Criminals could intercept your customers' personal data, such as passwords or credit card information. There is also the risk that criminals may install viruses or Trojans on your website. In such a case, you may even be liable for damages suffered by your visitors. Criminals could also create seemingly "legitimate" duplicates of your website. With theses faked "phishing" sites, personal data such as passwords or credit card information can be intercepted while the customer believes that he or she is visiting your company website.
