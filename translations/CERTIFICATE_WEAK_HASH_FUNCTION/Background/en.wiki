[[Certificate|Server certificates]] increase security on the internet and are used to verify websites. A certificate is issued and verified by an official, trustworthy institution. A certificate cannot be forged - in case of a weak hash algorithm (encryption), it can be swapped by a third party. In everyday life, a certificate can be compared to an identity card or a notarized document. Similar to a passport, certificates are also valid for a certain period of time. Thus certificates make it possible to exchange data via secure connections and form an important basis of trust for operators of online shops.
