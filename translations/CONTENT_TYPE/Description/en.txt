The content type is a declaration that is usually placed in the header of a web page, the so-called HTTP header. This declaration defines the character set and the type of data that the page contains. If the definition is missing, the [[Browser|Webbrowser]] will try to guess the content type; this can lead to security flaws such as [[Sniffer|Code-Page-Sniffing]]. This information is also important for rendering the web page correctly in every [[Browser]] and on every computer. If a server sends a document to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent User Agent] (for example to the [[Browser]]), it is helpful to supply some information about the file format in the content type field of the HTTP header. This information declares the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type MIME type] and sends the character encoding of the document, such as text/html, text/plain, etc. to the browser.
