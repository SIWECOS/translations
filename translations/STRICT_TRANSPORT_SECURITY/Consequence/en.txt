Currently, your website is not protected against using an outdated TLS standard (protocol downgrade attacks) and against cookie hijacking. This allows an attacker to intercept and manipulate your user's communication. Using this information, an attacker could launch further attacks or spam your users with unwanted advertisements and malicious code. HTTP Strict Transport Security is an excellent feature to strengthen your site and its implementation of [[SSL|TLS]] by forcing the user agent to use HTTPS.
