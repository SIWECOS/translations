'''Note on spelling:''' The correct English spelling is '''Referrer'''. However, the original RFC ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-14.37 RFC 2068]) contained an accidental misspelling ''Referer'' and thus raises this spelling to the standard within HTTP. In other standards such as DOM, the correct spelling is used. When a Referrer is set, the web browser sets its own Header, which is then called e.g. `Referer: google.com`. IN this case, Referrer fit spelled wrongly, but is correct according to the standard.
