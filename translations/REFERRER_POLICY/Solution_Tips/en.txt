We recommend that the Referrer Policy Header be set to be as restrictive as possible, i.e. to be set to ”no-referrer," for example.

= = Examples = = 
'''Referrer Policy Definition by Server Header:'''
<pre> # Referrer Policy 
Header set referrer-Policy "no-referrer" </pre> 

'''Referrer Policy Definition by HTML code:'''
<pre> <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer" "/> </pre>
'''Statement:''' The value `'''no-referrer'''` instructs the browser to send '''Never''' ''Referer Header'', which is provided by your site. This includes links to pages on your own website.

<br/> 
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;”
| style="border: 4px solid #C31622; color:#000000; background-color:#f6f6f6;" 
| Other useful instructions can be `'''same-origin'''`, `'''strict-origin'''` or `'''origin-when-cross-origin`'''.
|}
<br/>
 The value `'''same origin'''` instructs the browser to send only ''Referer Header'' provided by your website. If the target is another [[domain]], no referrer information will be sent.

The value `'''strict-origin'''` instructs the browser, to always indicate the origin domain as ''Referer Header''.

The value '''origin-when-cross-origin'''` instructs the browser to send the full referrer URL only if you stay on the same [[Domain]]. Once the domain is left via [[HTTPS]] or another [[Domain]]  is addressed, only the source domain is sent.
