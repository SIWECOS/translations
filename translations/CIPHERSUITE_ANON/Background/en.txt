The term [[Cipher Suite]] stands for a collection of cryptographic methods (encryption of information). This collection contains the key exchange method, the signature method, the encryption, and cryptographic [[Hashing|Hash-Funktionen]]. This combination of cryptographic components ensures that there is a secure connection for the communication between two parties, for example your [[Browser]] and a web server or website. In the TLS protocol ([[Transport Layer Security]]), the [[Cipher Suite]] (cryptographic method) determines which algorithms are used to establish a secure data connection, and it ensures that the connection is secure.
