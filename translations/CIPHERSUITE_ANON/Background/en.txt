The term [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite cipher suite] stands for a collection of cryptographic methods (encryption of information). This collection contains the key exchange method, the signature method, the encryption, and cryptographic hash function. This combination of cryptographic components ensures that there is a secure connection for the communication between two parties, for example your browser and a web server or website. In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security TLS] protocol (Transport Layer Security), the ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite cipher suite] (cryptographic method) determines which algorithms are used to establish a secure data connection, and it ensures that the connection is secure.
