The term [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite cipher suite] stands for a cryptographic protocol that contains the key exchange method, the signature method, the encryption, and cryptographic hash function. This combination of cryptographic components ensures that there is a secure connection for the communication between two parties, for example your browser and a web server or website. In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security TLS] protocol (Transport Layer Security), the cipher suite determines which algorithms are used to establish a secure data connection.
