The term [[Cipher Suite]] stands for a cryptographic protocol that contains the key exchange method, the signature method, the encryption, and cryptographic [[Hashing|Hash-Funktionen]]. This combination of cryptographic components ensures that there is a secure connection for the communication between two parties, for example your [[Browser]] and a web server or website. In the TLS protocol ([[Transport Layer Security]]), the [[Cipher Suite]] determines which algorithms are used to establish a secure data connection.
