A content management system [[Content-Management-Systeme|CMS]] is a software that allows a team of authors to collectively create, edit and manage content, mainly on websites, but also for other media types. If an attacker can find out which CMS version is being used, he or she can search for security flaws more effectively. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system more >>]
