In the standard settings, most Internet browser are configured so that websites with an expired [[Certificate/EN|certificate]] are not trusted. A website with an expired certificate will generate a warning message whenever it is accessed. Some browser or plug-ins, depending on their configuration settings, can block access your website completely. If visitors to your website receive a warning message, this will have a negative effect on your company's presentation on the internet. If internet browser do not trust your website, why should your customers trust you? An expired SSL certificate will also have a negative effect on search engine rank. Your company may no longer be listed at the top of a search engine results page, and it may move down the page even further if the problem persists. Visitors may even be alerted in the search results that there is a security issue on your website.
