[[Spam]] is unwanted email advertising in your inbox with sometimes dubious content (for example advertisements for viagra, medications, insurance, or credit offers). These advertisements are sent in large quantities, but they can also be targeted specifically. Attackers usually conceal their true identity and try to trick you.
