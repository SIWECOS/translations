The login data for the website may have been compromised by a malware infection on the computer, or by criminals hacking the website from the outside. Unnoticed by the owners of the website, malicious code for spam content is deposited on the [[Server|Host/Webspace]]. It is also possible that attackers gained access via the administrator login of the [[Content-Management-Systeme|CMS]], or that they may have exploited security flaws in outdated [[Plugin|Plugins]] in order to upload [[Malware|Schadcode]]. Through the use of these files, spam content is injected into the WordPress theme or into the database, thus creating concealed links to malicious websites.
