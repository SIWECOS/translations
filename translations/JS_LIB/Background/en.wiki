JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language that was originally developed in 1995 by Netscape for dynamic [[HTML]] in [[Browser|Webbrowsern]]. It is used to evaluate user interactions or to modify, reload, or generate content, thereby expanding the capabilities of HTML and CSS. JavaScript code that is frequently used by developers is stored in external libraries. If a website uses an unsafe JavaScript library, it is potentially vulnerable.
