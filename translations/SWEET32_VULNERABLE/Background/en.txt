Sweet32 is the name of an attack that was carried out by researchers on the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA). The attack exploits design flaws in some encryption algorithms. These encryption algorithms are used in widely used protocols such as TLS, SSH, IPsec and OpenVPN. The Sweet32 attack allows an attacker under some circumstances to restore small sections of a test if it was encoded with 64-bit block ciphers (such as Triple-DES and Blowfish).
