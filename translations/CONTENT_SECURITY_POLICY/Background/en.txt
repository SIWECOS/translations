Content Security Policy (CSP) requires careful coordination and precise definition of the security concept. If this option is enabled, CSP has considerable impact on the way the browser renders pages (for example, inline Javascript is disabled by default and must be allowed explicitly in the policy). CSP can prevend a number of attachs such as [[Cross-Site Scripting]] and other attacks which inject data in web pages.
