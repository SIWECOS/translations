SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) stands for a hybrid encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet and serves as the basis for secure access via HTTPS. The SSL3 version dates from 1995 and has not been officially supported since 2015. The term SSL has since been replaced by the term TLS (Transport Layer Security). The SSL3 gap became particularly known through POODLE. By using SSL3, the confidentiality of the connections can no longer be guaranteed.
