SSL3 is not supported any more by most internet browsers. Most browsers are configured to warn users against visiting SSL3 websites, or even to block access to them completely. The warning message that your visitors receive will have a negative effect on your company's presentation on the internet. If internet browsers do not trust your website, why should your customers trust you? The further use of SSL3 will also have a negative effect on search engine rank, and visitors will be alerted in the search results that there is a security issue on your website.
