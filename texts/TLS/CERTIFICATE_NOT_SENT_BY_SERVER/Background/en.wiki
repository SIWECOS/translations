It is theoretically possible to configure a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security TLS server] so that it will not send a [[Certificate|certificate]] to identify itself and only encrypt without signing its public key. A client that wants to connect to the server cannot check whether it is really communicating with the server it expects. This type of configuration is very rare.
