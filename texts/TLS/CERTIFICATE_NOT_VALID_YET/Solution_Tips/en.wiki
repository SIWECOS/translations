If ''Certificate is not yet valid'' was reported, deactivate the [[Certificate|certificate]] while it is not yet valid. Your website will then not be certified, but at least visitors will not receive a warning message when they open your website. Alternatively, it is possible to use your old certificate while it is still valid. For information on how to renew certificate, please refer to: [[Certificate-Expired/EN|certificate expired]].
