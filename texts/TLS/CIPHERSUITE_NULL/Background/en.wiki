The term Cipher Suite stands for a group of cryptographic functions that includes the key exchange procedure, signature procedure, encryption and cryptographic hash functions. This combination of cryptographic components ensures a secure connection between two parties, such as your browser and a web server/website. In the TLS protocol (Transport Layer Security), the Cipher Suite determines which algorithms should be used to establish a secure data connection.
