If is was reported, that the HTTP header X-Frame-Options is not set, your website is not sufficiently protected from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking clickjacking attacks].

Set in the HTTP header X-Frame-Options according to your requirements. The '''X-Frame-Options''' field in the HTTP header can be used to determine whether a browser is allowed to render or embed the target page in a <frame>, <iframe> or <object>. Websites can use this header to deflect clickjacking attacks by preventing their content from being embedded in third party pages.

With the HTTP-Header command X-Frame-Options, modern web browsers can be instructed to prevent loading a page in a frame on another website. To do this, the following setting must be entered in the .htaccess file:

Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY

'''--snip'''
<pre>
Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY
</pre>
'''—snap'''

Alternatively, you can permit the page to be embedded only in other pages within the same domain:

'''--snip'''
<pre>
Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
</pre>
'''—snap'''

If a website must be embedded in an external page, a domain can be specified:

'''--snip'''
<pre>
Header always append X-Frame-Options ALLOW-FROM botfrei.de
</pre>
'''—snap'''


Here is an example of an .htaccess file which will set the '''Header Scanner''' to green.
