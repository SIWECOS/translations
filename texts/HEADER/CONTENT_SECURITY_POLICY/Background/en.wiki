[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy Content Security Policy (CSP)] requires careful coordination and precise definition of the security concept. When this option is enabled, CSP has a significant impact on the way the browser renders (composes) the pages. For example, inline [[JavaScript]] is disabled by default and must be explicitly allowed in the policy. The CSP can help mitigate code injection attacks.
