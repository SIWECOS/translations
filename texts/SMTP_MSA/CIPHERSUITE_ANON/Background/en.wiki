The term Cipher Suite stands for a collection of cryptographic methods used (encryption of information). This collection includes the key exchange method, digital signature, encryption and cryptographic hash functions. This combination of cryptographic components ensures a secure connection between two parties, e.g. your mail program and a server. In the TLS protocol, the Cipher Suite (cryptographic procedure) determines which algorithms are to be used to establish a secure data connection and is decisively responsible for the security of the connection.
