SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) stands for a hybrid (combined) encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet and serves as the basis for secure access via HTTPS. The SSL2 version dates back to 1994 and has not been officially supported since 2011. The term SSL has since been replaced by the term TLS (Transport Layer Security). For example, the SSL2 gap serves as a gateway for a DROWN attack, which allows criminals to read the entire data traffic of your website.
