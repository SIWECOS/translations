The term Cipher Suite stands for a collection of cryptographic methods used (encryption of information). This collection includes the key exchange procedure, the signature procedure, the encryption and cryptographic hash functions. This combination of cryptographic individual components ensures the secure connection in communication between two parties, e.g. your mail program and a server. In the TLS protocol, the cipher suite (cryptographic procedure) determines which algorithms are to be used to establish a secure data connection and is responsible for the security of the connection.
