== Which security tools can block Siwecos scans? ==

=== Firewall ===

Make sure your firewall whitelists our IP addresses.

We currently use the following IP addresses:

- 159.69.220.230 (scanner)<br>
- 116.203.133.16 (test scanner)

=== PortSentry ===

Security tools such as "PortSentry" could be a reason why our scanners cannot perform port scans (which are part of the investigation). 

To prevent own systems from getting caught by portsentry, there is the file »/etc/portsentry/portsentry.ignore.static« . Here you can define single hosts or whole networks that are spared from all countermeasures.

We currently use the following IP addresses:

- 159.69.220.230 (scanner)<br>
- 116.203.133.16 (test scanner)
