== What is an .htaccess file? ==

An .htaccess file is a text file which is used to determine the configuration of an Apache web server if you do not have direct access to the web server's main configuration file (httpd.conf), or if you do not want to make changes to it because this would require restarting the Apache web server. For example, you do not have direct access to the ''httpd.conf'' file if your website is hosted by a hosting service provider such as 1&1 or Strato.

Generally, the '''.htaccess''' file is uploaded to the main directory of the website, beccause the configuration settings specified in this file always apply to all files in the main directory and all its subdirectories. Thus the .htaccess-Datei allows you to define directory-specific rules, because the file is one component of the webserver's configuration.


== How do I edit the .htaccess file? ==

[[File:htaccess_erstellen.png|left|400px]] To create a new .htaccess file, open your editor (for example Notepad or Notepad++) and select '''File => new''' to create a new text file. Specify the required individual changes to the configuration, and save the file with the "Save as" command under the file name '''.htaccess''' (without file extension) (see image, click to enlarge).
