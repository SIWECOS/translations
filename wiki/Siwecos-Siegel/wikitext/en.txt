== Embedding the Siwecos seal on your website ==
<br />
[[File:siwecos_siegel.png|left|200px]] To show when the Siwecos scanners last checked your website, you can embed our Siwecos seal on your website.
<br />
<br />
<br />
'''Please note that the seal can only be embedded if you have [https://siwecos.de/app/#/register registered] with Siwecos!'''
<br />
<span style="color:#c31622"><font size="5">
There are three ways to embed the Siwecos seal on your website
</font><span>
<br />
<p>
'''Note''': Currently you cannot use the seal on Domains with IDN names.
</p>
<br />
=='''<span style="color:#c31622">Option 1:<span>''' (seal is stored locally in your own webspace)==

For this option, you store a small JavaScript file locally on your webserver. The advantage is that the seal will be shown on your website even if the Siwecos server is not available. In this case, only the date of the last scan will be replaced by '''Standby'''.

<br />
'''Instructions:'''
* "'''Right-click with the mouse'''" on '''[https://siwecos.de/wp-content/plugins/seal-of-trust/seal.js seal.js]''' and, depending on your operating system, select "'''Save link as'''" or "'''Save target as'''" (see images), and save the seal image file in a directory of your choice (for example on the desktop).<br />

* Then upload the file to your website directory on the server of your hosting provider. In this directory, there is usually a subdirectory for '''JavaScript (for example 'src')'''. Save the file '''"seal.js"''' in this subdirectory.<br />
* After this, the following code must be copied into the start page at the position where you want the seal to be shown:

Explanation for the source code:

*'''width''' the width of the seal to be displayed.
*'''height''' the heigth of the seal to be displayed.
*'''data-siwecos''' your domain, without http / https{{#if:{{#urlget:userdomain}} | &nbsp;({{#urlget: userdomain}}) }}.
*'''format''' (optional) the desired format.
*'''src''' the path where the JavaScript can be found, for example /src/seal.js.

The date's format ideally consist of 5 characters. The recommended Formats are:

*'''d.m.y''' for british english format.
*'''y-m-d''' for ISO-8601 format.

=='''<span style="color:#c31622">Option 2:<span>'''  (seal is loaded from the Siwecos server)==

This option is intended for users who are not familiar with website editing. All you need to do is to copy the provided code into the source code of your website and to enter the name of your website '''("my_Website")'''. '''The drawback of this option''' is that the image for the seal is loaded directly from the Siwecos server. If the Siwecos server is not available, the seal will not be displayed on your website.


* Copy the code into your source code, for example into the start page of your website.

=='''<span style="color:#c31622">Option 3:<span>''' (Seal as a static image)==

For this option you store the seal statically on your website. No data ('''e.g. the date of the daily scan''') will be loaded from Siwecos.
