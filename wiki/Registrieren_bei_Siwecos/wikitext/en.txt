== Registration with Siwecos ==

The project '''Siwecos''' was founded by [https://www.eco.de/ Eco] (Verband der Internetwirtschaft) and [http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ RUB] (Ruhruniversit√§t Bochum) to help small and medium-sized companies to have their websites checked for security flaws and potentially malicious code. To do this, a number of scanners have been developed that will alert you to configuration errors and malware.

In order to have your domains checked for security flaws with the Siwecos scanners, you must first register and then login with your personal data. Your data will '''in no case be passed on to third parties'''.

== Verification ==

All domains which are registered for verification at Siwecos must be verified and cross-checked. To do this, two different methods are available (meta tag or file).


'''Verification by file or meta tag'''
{|
|-

<br />
<br />

== Delete domain ==

The domain will be deleted from our system completely, including all scan results. It is not possible to restore the deleted data. However, you can register the domain again with the verification procedure. '''Please note:''' When the domain has been deleted from our system, please remove any stored '''Meta tags or HTML files''' from your system.
