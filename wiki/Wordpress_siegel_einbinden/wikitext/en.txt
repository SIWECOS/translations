== Embedding the Siwecos seal in Wordpress ==

{|
|- In the Content Managment System '''Wordpress''', you can embed the Siwecos seal even without FTP access.
|
'''Instructions:''' <br>
* "'''Right-click with the mouse'''" on '''[https://siwecos.de/wp-content/plugins/seal-of-trust/seal.js seal.js]''' and, depending on your operating system, select "'''Save link as'''" or "'''Save target as'''", and save the seal image file in a directory of your choice (for example on the desktop).<br>
* In the next step, on the right-hand side in WordPress, select the menu option '''"Media"''' and click the option '''"Select file"''' (image) in the media center, then select the file "seal.js" that you saved previously.

* When the seal image file has been uploaded to the media center, it must be embedded in your website. To do this, select the menu option '''"Design"''' - '''"Widgets"'''.
* As you can see in our illustration, there is a selection of widgets (audio, image, gallery) from which you select the '''"HTML block"''' and insert it in the area (for example Footer1) where you want the seal to be displayed.

* Copy the given code into the HTML widget.
* Please note that you must replace the code section '''"My domain"''' by the name your domain as registered with Siwecos, for example '''www.botfrei.de'''.
* The path for the image must be changed accordingly (for example '''/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/seal.js''')
